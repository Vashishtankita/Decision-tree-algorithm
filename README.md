# Description:
This project focuses on predicting diabetes in individuals using a decision tree classifier. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and body mass index.

#The workflow includes:
- Data exploration and visualization to understand patterns and distributions.
- Preprocessing steps like handling missing values and encoding target variables.
- Training and evaluating a decision tree classifier for initial predictions.
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

# Key Features:
- Data Visualization: Histogram and exploratory analysis for feature insights.
- Preprocessing: Handling missing data and encoding categorical variables.
- Model Training: Building a decision tree classifier with the rpart library.
- Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning using the caret library to improve accuracy.
- Performance Metrics: Confusion matrix and accuracy calculation for evaluation.

#Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: R
- Libraries: mlbench, rpart, caret, ggplot2, dplyr

#Results:
- Baseline Accuracy: Achieved using a standard decision tree model.
- Optimized Accuracy: Improved after hyperparameter tuning.
